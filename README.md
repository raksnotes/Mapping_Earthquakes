# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to map Tectonic Plate data and Major Earthquake data. 

Referenced 14.5 & 14.6 for logicStep1-5. 

In the JS code, I had to reinitialize the same variables with different names because I was getting a constant syntax error that variables had already been declared. 
Therefore, when coding logicStep2, I renamed map to map1 in logicStep2, renamed map1 to map2 in logicStep3 etc 

I was able to successfully output a map according to requirements of Deliverable 1 and Deliverable 2. When the code is run, I was able to toggle between the different layers, Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, Major Earthquakes, as well as toggle between Streets and Satellite.
